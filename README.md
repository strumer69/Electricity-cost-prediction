# Electricity-cost-prediction

🏠 Electricity Cost Prediction - Simple Regression Model
This project uses a basic linear regression model to predict electricity prices based on various features like:

Site area

Water consumption

Recycling rate

Utilisation rate

Air quality index

Issue resolution time

Resident count

Structure type (encoded)

📉 Despite no advanced data preparation or feature engineering, and possible unknown parameters affecting the data, the model achieves an R² score of 0.81, indicating a moderately strong linear relationship.

💡 This dataset is especially useful for exploring how factors like water usage, area size, and building type may influence electricity pricing.
